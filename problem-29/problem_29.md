# Distinct Powers

Consider all integer combinations of a^b for 2 <= a <=5 and 2 <= b <= 5:

2^2, 2^3, 2^4, 2^5, 3^2, 3^3 ...
 
If they are then placed in numerical order, with any repeats removed, we get the following sequence of 15 distinct terms:
4,8,9,16,25,27,...,1024,3125

How many distinct terms are in the sequence generated by a^b for 2 <= a <= 100 and 2 <= b <= 100?
